- 👋 Hi, I’m Kenny Hermus! I am a curious and hard working computer science student. I have an extensive background in Java and Python as well as knowledge on C++, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and Microsoft Office. I have strong leadership qualities, work well in a team due to my communication skills and emotional intuition, am a good presenter, and I think critically. I always step up to a challenge and overcome it with adept problem solving, planning, and time management skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL and AWS.
- 💞️ I’m seeking a co-op or internship opportunity at a cutting edge, innovative facility to improve my programming knowledge and learn and work with project teams.
- 📫 Feel free to email me at kenny.hermus08@gmail.com
